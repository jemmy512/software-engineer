/* Hard
Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any node sequence from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.



Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Example 2:


Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 3 * 104].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000 */
