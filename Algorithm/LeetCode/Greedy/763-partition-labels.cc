/* Medium
A string S of lowercase English letters is given.
We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible
so that each letter appears in at most one part,
and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

Example 1:
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.

Note:
S will have length in range [1, 500].
S will consist of lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z') only.
